# Bath-ToDoList
Hello! This project is a basic To-Do List but created with the purpose to take a bath. 

You must be thinking who will ever need a list with the steps to take a bath? But the right question is: with your phone inside your water proove case, who will not?

In Brazil, we had a show that was 
called "Castelo RÃ¡-Tim-Bum" about a magical castle with wonderfull creatures that teaches you music, art and sciense. On that show exists a mouse that sing a song to encourages you to take a bath and provide the step by step to do so.

This app is 100% based on his job so hope you enjoy it as much is i did!

Now lets get ~~physicall~~ technicall: The project was a lot of firsts for me. My project has more than one view and for the comunication with the second view i want it to be like on top of the first one, not a entire separete view, so i present the second one using the method Sheets. I also implement the "List" concept with the method For Each() and made it editable with TextField style and deletable with the .onDelete modifier. For adding more steps was created a handler and a function the it is called in the button "New Mission to take a bath".
