# Bath-ToDoList
Hello! This project is a basic to-do list, but it was created with the purpose of helping you take a bath. You may be thinking, "Who needs a list for that?" But with your phone in a waterproof case, who will not?

In Brazil, there was a show called "Castelo RÃ¡-Tim-Bum" about a magical castle with wonderful creatures that taught you music, art, and science. On that show, there was a mouse that sang a song to encourage you to take a bath and provided a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

This app is 100% based on his job, so I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Now lets get ~~physical~~ technical: This project was a lot of firsts for me. It has more than one view, and for the communication with the second view, I wanted it to be on top of the first one, not a completely separate view. So, I presented the second view using the Sheets method. I also implemented the "list" concept with the For Each() method and made it editable with the TextField style and deletable with the .onDelete modifier. To add more steps, I created a handler and a function that is called when the "New Mission to Take a Bath" button is clicked.
